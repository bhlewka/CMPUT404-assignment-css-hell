<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> I'm a 21 year old 4th year computing science student at the University of Alberta. 
In my spare time I enjoy rock climbing, super smash bros melee, and eating donairs. 
I have a 6 month old kitten named Willow <img src="willow.jpg" alt="Willow and Ben" width="400" height="200" style="vertical-align:middle" >and I love her very much.</br>
</br></br></br>
</p>
</p>
<h2> My Resume </h2>
<p> I was the president of a university club for 2 years, running events as well as managing a club bank account of around $6000. 
I would run smash tournaments in a warehouse, and my responsibilities included opening and closing the building, setting up and cleaning up the events, including setting up tables, carrying TV's, and setting up game consoles. 
I would then run registration and sell club memberships, as well as organize the tournament bracket and ensure that it runs properly, WHILE competing in it at the same time. 
I was also a checker over summer for an highway paving project. </p>
<h2> What do I bring to the table </h2>
<p> Sufficient in Python, SQLite, Java, HTML/CSS (clearly). 
I am pretty good at climbing things so if something is high up and needs to be retrieved I can grab it. 
I'm also pretty good at smash bros melee so if you need me to beat your friends or coworkers I can also do that. 
Caring for kittens is also something I can do. </p>
